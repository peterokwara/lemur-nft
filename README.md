### About the website

A decentralized application that allows people to mint an NFT.

### Technical

#### Technology Used

This project uses: - Web3j - AndroidStudio - VSCode - Truffle - Ngrok - NPM
- Web3j: Lightweight Java and Android library for integration with Ethereum clients. https://www.web3labs.com/web3j-sdk
- Android Studio: Official integrated development environment for Googleâ€™s Android operating system. https://developer.android.com/studio
- Truffle: Smart contract development tool. https://trufflesuite.com
- Ngrok: A reverse proxy service for fronting your web service. https://ngrok.com/
- VSCode: A code editor. https://code.visualstudio.com/
- NPM: Node package manager. https://www.npmjs.com/


#### Running the project

##### Contracts

Navigate into the `/contract` folder. Install the npm packages by running. 

```console
npm install
```

Compile the smart contract by running:

```console
truffle compile
```

On a separate terminal, run `ganache`. This runs an ethereum node that we can connect to.

```console
ganache
```

Make sure you save the **seed** and the **first available account**.

Run `ngrok` on a separate terminal. This will act as a forward proxy and expose our ethereum node, making it reachable to the internet.

```console
ngrok http 8545
```

You can now deploy your smart contract to your local ethereum network by running:

```console
truffle migrate --network development
```

Make sure to save the **contract address** since we are going to use it later. 

##### Android

An `apikey.properties` file needs to be created and filled with the following values:

```
    WALLET_ADDRESS="" 
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS="" 
    WEB_SOCKET_URL=""
    SEED=""
    TOKEN_URI="https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVjYxCFynL9A7V5DRHefLxmsqnNp1eCCv1QLU1cfcGnjz"
```

As a recap
- We obtained the WALLET_ADDRESS by taking the first public key after running the ganache command.
- We obtained the CONTRACT_ADDRESS after running truffle migrate --network development and taking the contract address from the 1_deploy_contract.js section.
- We obtained the SEED after running the ganache command and obtaining the seed generated.

With this, you should be able to run the android app.

The `LemurNft.java` file was created by running:

```console
web3j generate truffle --truffle-json .\build\contracts\lemurNFT.json -o ..\android\app\src\main\java\ -p com.example.lemur
```

The file was then moved to the `android\app\src\main\java\com\example\lemur` directory, next to the `MainActivity.kt` file.

#### CONTRIBUTING

I would/ We'd love to have your help in making **{this app (Lemur NFT)}** better. The project is still very incomplete, but if there's an issue you'd like to see addressed sooner rather than later, let me(/us) know.
